# Guessing-Game
This Python program is a number guessing game where players guess a random number between 1 and 10. Players input their name and attempt to guess the number within the given range,
receiving clues after each guess. It tracks the number of attempts, displays the high score, and allows players to play multiple rounds or exit. The program includes input validation 
for error handling, ensuring valid numerical guesses.
